We’re best known for making Basecamp, HEY, and ONCE, writing business and software books (Getting Real, REWORK, REMOTE, It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work, and Shape Up), and inventing the Ruby on Rails framework. Click the dot at bottom right to advance, or wander through the numbered list ad hoc. Have fun."
